Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). Serve with lemon wedges and French bread.\r\n\r\nNote: if using fresh shrimp, arrange for presentation. Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. ",

Remove from the heat and let cool while, in a separate bowl, you beat the eggs until creamy. \r\n\r\nWhen the boiled syrup has cooled, beat in the eggs, salt and pecans. Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* A little cream (about 1\/4 to 1\/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. \r\n\r\n* For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. \r\n\r\n* The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.

Add the yolk mixture to the flour mixture and, using a wooden spoon, stir until well blended.

Using a silicone spatula, fold about one-third of the egg whites into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the rest just until no white streaks remain. Stir in fresh dill.\r\n\r\nBrush the wells of the ebelskiver pan with some of the remaining melted butter and place over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, add about 1 tablespoon batter to each well. Working quickly, carefully spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the smoked salmon into the center of each pancake, then spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese on top. Top each with another 1 tablespoon batter. (Alternatively, gently mix the cream cheese and salmon together. Spoon about 1 teaspoon into the center of each pancake)\r\n\r\nCook until the bottoms of the pancakes are lightly browned and crisp, 3-5 minutes. Use 2 short wooden skewers to turn all the  pancakes and cook until lightly browned on the second side, about 3 minutes longer.\r\n\r\nTransfer the finished pancakes to a platter and keep warm  in the oven while you repeat to make 2 more batches.

Add in eggs and yolks pulsing a couple times again and scrape down to ensure all is smooth and uniform. With machine running, pour in melted Godiva Chocolate in a steady stream until all in, and finish by pulsing in the cr\u00e8me fraiche. Pour batter into a 10\" x 10\" baking pan and bake at 325 for 30, minutes or until custard is set and a toothpick inserted in center can be removed cleanly. The top may caramelize or brown slightly, which is not an issue. Once set, remove from oven and allow cheesecake to cool completely. Wrap the pan with plastic and reserve in cooler to set and chill completely.\r\n\r\nOnce the cheesecake is cold and firm, remove it from the pan and place in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment. Beat the cake for a few moments to soften and smooth out the custard. Place smoothed custard into a piping bag with a plain tip and pipe into the bottom of a plastic lined half cylinder mold. Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.",

Working in batches, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat; pick up each slice of butter and press between floured fingertips into flat, nickel-sized pieces.  Repeat until all butter is incorporated; toss to combine.  Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nSpray 24-square-inch work surface with nonstick cooking spray; spread spray evenly across surface with kitchen towel or paper towel.  Sprinkle 1\/3 cup of extra flour across sprayed area; gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating.  Add all but 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to flour mixture; stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl).  With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared work surface, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.\r\n\r\nPat dough into approximate 10-inch square; roll into 18- by 14-inch rectangle about 1\/4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed.  Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface; lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6- by 4-inch rectangle.  Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting work surface underneath with flour; roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.\r\n\r\nRoll dough into 10-inch square about 1\/2 inch thick; flip dough and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut.  Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into ball; roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough.  Roll dough into 1\/2-inch-thick round; cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet.  Discard excess dough.\r\n\r\nBrush biscuit tops with melted butter.  Bake, without opening oven door, until tops are golden brown and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes.  Let cool on baking sheet 5 to 10 minutes before serving.",
